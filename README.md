### Hi there 
- My name is Abdelrahman, but you can call me Abdo. I'm a 20-year-old student from Egypt , and I'm passionate about development. Over the past year, I've been learning and practicing web development, and I've already completed several projects. I have experience front-end technologies such as HTML CSS, JavaScript, Sass, Bootstrap and Angular. I also have experience working with back-end technologies, such as Node.js and Express, and integrating with RESTful APIs.

<!-- -   using HTML CSS, JavaScript, Sass, Bootstrap and Angular  -->
 
- While I am currently studying Management Information Systems, I am not limited to this field and enjoy exploring other areas of development as well. also I work part-time to gain practical experience and supplement my income. Balancing work and studying can be challenging, , but I find ways to handle it. By staying organized, managing my time effectively, and prioritizing my tasks.

- During my free time, I enjoy playing video games, and watching movies, TV shows, and anime. I find that these hobbies help me relax and recharge so I can continue to be productive and focused. 


- 🌱 I’m currently learning C++, practicing Angular.
