### Hi there 
my name is Abdelrahman, but you can call me Abdo. I'm a 19-year-old student from Egypt, currently studying Management Information Systems. I've always had a passion for coding, and I've been putting my skills to use for the past two years.

In addition to coding, I'm a big fan of gaming, music, movies, TV shows, and anime. I find that these hobbies help me relax and unwind after a long day of work and study.
